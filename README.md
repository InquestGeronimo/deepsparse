<h3> DeepSparse is a deep learning inference engine for running super-fast sparse models. üöÄüöÄüöÄ</h3>

A CPU runtime engine delivering GPU-class performance by taking advantage of sparsity within neural networks to reduce compute required as well as accelerate memory bound workloads. Read more about sparsification [here](https://docs.neuralmagic.com/main/source/getstarted.html#sparsification).

## Install üíΩ
Tested on Python 3.6+, and ONNX 1.5.0+. [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is highly recommended!!

```bash
pip install deepsparse
```
__ __
## Quick Start üíª

One of the greatest features of our inference engine is the ability to integrate into popular deep learning libraries (e.g. Hugging Face, Ultralytics) allowing you to leverage DeepSparse for loading and deploying sparse models with ONNX runtime (ORT). ORT gives flexibility to serve your model in a framework agnostic environment. Support includes [PyTorch,](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) [TensorFlow,](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) [Keras,](https://github.com/onnx/keras-onnx) and [many other frameworks](https://github.com/onnx/onnxmltools).

To begin your inference adventure with DeepSparse is super simple. You can either run DeepSparse in CLI or  in Python. 

Let's first check out the CLI features... üëá
__ __

## Working in CLI with DeepSparse Server & Benchmark

After you've installed DeepSparse in your Python environment, you have two resources via CLI at your disposal:
- `deepsparse.server` :
    - If you are interested in serving your models. 
- `deepsparse.benchmark` :
    - If you are interested in experimenting with the throughput/latency performance of your models under different inference scenarios.

### 1. DeepSparse Server

The DeepSparse inference server allows you to serve models and pipelines in deployment. The server runs on top of the popular FastAPI web framework and Uvicorn web server.

 - run `deepsparse.server -h` to lookup arguments.

##### ‚≠ê Single Model ‚≠ê

Example CLI command for running inference with a single model:

```bash
deepsparse.server --task question_answering --model_path "zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/base-none"
```

##### ‚≠ê Multiple Models ‚≠ê
To serve multiple models in your deployment you can easily build a `config.yaml`. 
In the example below, we are defining 2 BERT models in our configuration:

    models:
    - task: question_answering
        model_path: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/base-none
        batch_size: 1
        alias: question_answering/dense
    - task: question_answering
        model_path: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/pruned_quant-aggressive_95
        batch_size: 1
        alias: question_answering/sparse_quantized

Finally, after your `config.yaml` file is built, you can run the server with the config file path as an argument:
```bash
deepsparse.server --config_file config.yaml
```

### 2. Deepsparse Benchmark

The benchmark tool is available on your CLI to run expressive model benchmarks on the DeepSparse Engine with minimal parameters.

Run `deepsparse.benchmark -h` to look up arguments.


```shell
deepsparse.benchmark [-h] [-b BATCH_SIZE] [-shapes INPUT_SHAPES]
                          [-ncores NUM_CORES] [-s {async,sync}] [-t TIME]
                          [-nstreams NUM_STREAMS] [-pin {none,core,numa}]
                          [-q] [-x EXPORT_PATH]
                            model_path

```

- [Getting Started with CLI Benchmarking](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/main/src/deepsparse/benchmark_model) Includes examples of inference scenarios such as: 
    - Synchronous (Single-stream) Scenario
    - Asynchronous (Multi-stream) Scenario

Let's now try running DeepSparse via Python... üëá
__ __

## NLP Inference üë©‚Äçüíª Question Answering

```python
from deepsparse.transformers import pipeline

# SparseZoo model stub or path to ONNX file
onnx_filepath="zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/pruned-aggressive_98"

qa_pipeline = pipeline(
    task="question-answering",
    model_path=onnx_filepath,
    num_cores=None, # uses all available CPU cores by default
)

my_name = qa_pipeline(question="What's my name?", context="My name is Snorlax")
```

Tasks Supported: 
- Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis)
- Question Answering

__ __
## CV Inference üë©‚Äçüíª Object Detection (Placeholder)

```python
from deepsparse.transformers import pipeline

# SparseZoo model stub or path to ONNX file
onnx_filepath="zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/pruned-aggressive_98"

qa_pipeline = pipeline(
    task="question-answering",
    model_path=onnx_filepath,
    num_cores=None, # uses all available CPU cores by default
)

my_name = qa_pipeline(question="What's my name?", context="My name is Snorlax")

## SparseZoo ONNX vs. Custom ONNX Models

DeepSparse can accept ONNX models from two sources: 

1. `SparseZoo ONNX`: our open-source collection of sparse models available for download. [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo) hosts inference-optimized models, trained on repeatable sparsification recipes using state-of-the-art techniques from [SparseML.](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml)

2. `Custom ONNX`: Your own onnx model, can be dense or sparse. Plug in your model to compare performance with other solutions. üëá


```bash
> wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/mobilenet/model/mobilenetv2-7.onnx
Saving to: ‚Äòmobilenetv2-7.onnx‚Äô
```

Custom ONNX Benchmark example:
```python
from deepsparse import compile_model
from deepsparse.utils import generate_random_inputs
onnx_filepath = "mobilenetv2-7.onnx"
batch_size = 16

# Generate random sample input
inputs = generate_random_inputs(onnx_filepath, batch_size)

# Compile and run
engine = compile_model(onnx_filepath, batch_size)
outputs = engine.run(inputs)
```
Compatibility/Support Notes
- ONNX version 1.5-1.7
- ONNX opset version 11+
- ONNX IR version has not been tested at this time

## Scheduling Single-Stream, Multi-Stream, and Elastic Inference ‚ö°

The DeepSparse Engine offers up to 3 types of inferences based on your use-case. You can read more details here: [Inference Types](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/docs/source/scheduler.md).

1 ‚ö° Single stream scheduling: the latency/synchronous scenario, requests execute serially. [`default`]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/single-stream.png" alt="single stream diagram" />

PRO TIP: It's highly optimized for minimum per-request latency, using all of the system's resources provided to it on every request it gets.

2 ‚ö° Multi-stream scheduling: the throughput/asynchronous scenario, requests execute in parallel.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/main/docs/source/multi-stream.png" alt="multi stream diagram" />

PRO TIP: The most common use cases for the multi-stream scheduler are where parallelism is low with respect to core count, and where requests need to be made asynchronously without time to batch them.

3 ‚ö° Elastic scheduling: requests execute in parallel, but not multiplexed on individual NUMA Nodes.

PRO TIP: A workload that might benefit from the elastic scheduler is one in which multiple requests need to be handled simultaneously, but where performance is hindered when those requests have to share an L3 cache.
__ __

## Hardware Support üß∞

The DeepSparse Engine is validated to work on x86 Intel and AMD CPUs running Linux operating systems. Mac and Windows require running Linux in a Docker or virtual machine.

It is highly recommended to run on a CPU with AVX-512 instructions available for optimal algorithms to be enabled. 

Here is a table detailing specific support for some algorithms over different microarchitectures:
